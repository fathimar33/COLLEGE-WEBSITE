Experiencing this can give you more courage to try again. Even when you ‘make it’ and raise a lot of money or sell your company, life isn’t over. You might unfortunately, have a much clearer picture of the struggles, but then you get to start again with a new startup, or become an angel investor yourself.”

                For the third year in a row, Aura architecture students participated in a universal design competition that put their creative and analytical skills to the test on a significantly sloped site. Thanks to AGM Container Controls and Ascension Wheelchair Lifts, the winning students received a total of $7,400 in prizes.
                Consistent with the studio’s theme of place, students responded to a variety of site factors for their projects, including sun, wind, climate, views, flora, fauna, culture and history. The support from AGM/Ascension enabled the studio to incorporate an additional challenge so that students also learn about topography and universal design, as they reconcile both.
